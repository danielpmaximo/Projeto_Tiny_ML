# ðŸ§  Tiny ML Project â€“ Audio Classification with MEL Spectrogram

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook developed for the **Tiny ML** project, focused on **audio classification** using neural networks. Audio files are converted into **MEL spectrogram images**, allowing machine learning techniques to process audio signals as images.

The goal of the project is to apply machine learning techniques on resource-constrained devices, such as microcontrollers, using visual representations of audio.
